# test1
for inicial testing
This is the final project from a PHP and MySQL medium course from an University.
In this project I learn to do a login/register page, with database confirmation and user creation.
I learn to create images from php code and use that with a random code to assemble a captcha image.
Also, I use session features to access an other page which is only for registrated users.
This is made with pure php, dont have any security or cripting.
